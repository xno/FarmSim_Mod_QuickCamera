[b][u]What can this mod be used for?[/u][/b]

With all the additional key-controls that modern vehicles and implements now has, it is not always feasible to switch between keyboard, mouse and steering-wheel all the time, as it may cause driving errors or worse...

So to look quickly around, this QuickCamera mod introduce "quick-tap keys" for both cabin camera and external cameras of a vehicle.

Make sure you go into 'Options' - 'Controls' in the game, and [b]assign your own keys[/b] to the "QuickCam:Look..." actions.

Now in-game, quick-tap the key that you assigned to the 'QuickCam:Look 45° Left' action, and the camera will rotate to the next 45-degree angle to the left, and so too for the 'QuickCam:Look 45° Right' action.

To look backwards, quick-tap the key that you assigned to the 'QuickCam:Look backward' action, and like so for the 'QuickCam:Look forward' action. You can also toggle between looking forward/backward by assigning a key to the 'QuickCam:Toggle look for/back' action.

If the selected camera is capable of zooming, a quick-tap on your 'QuickCam:Zoom out' key, will cause it to zoom out 15 units at a time. And likewise for your 'QuickCam:Zoom in' key.


[u]When player is 'on foot'[/u]

Version 1.1.0 introduced "quick-keys keys" for when the player avatar is 'on foot'.

In 'Options' - 'Controls' you can now specify which keys to use, to quickly turn the player 45 degrees left/right or do a u-turn.


[u]Default action/key assignments[/u]

When player is in a vehicle:
[b]RIGHT[/b] - Look 45° right
[b]LEFT[/b] - Look 45° left
[i]none[/i] - Look 90° right
[i]none[/i] - Look 90° left
[i]none[/i] - Peek 45° right
[i]none[/i] - Peek 45° left
[b]UP[/b] - Look forwards
[b]DOWN[/b] - Look backwards
[b]END[/b] - Toggle look forwards/backwards
[b]PAGE-UP[/b] - Zoom in
[b]PAGE-DOWN[/b] - Zoom out

When player is 'on foot':
[i]none[/i] - On foot turn 45° right
[i]none[/i] - On foot turn 45° left
[b]END[/b] - On foot turn 180°

[b][u]Problems or bugs?[/u][/b]

If you encounter problems or bugs using this mod, please use the support-thread.

Known bugs/problems/ToDo:
- Because this QuickCamera mod does not override the normal camera movement script, there might be a little movement first, before the camera snaps into position - IF you have assigned the same keys as for the normal look left/right/up/down.
- Sometimes when snapping to look forward/backward, the camera-rotation may rotate several times quickly. There's some math that I still haven't quite figured out how to solve.
